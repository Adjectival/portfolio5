          <p>My name is Alexander Jacks and I love communication technology. I graduated from a programming bootcamp in Portland, Oregon in 2017 so that I can help design interesting user experiences. I say this sincerely, yet the code projects I personally most enjoy creating tend to revolve around lists and datasets, but I also can lose track of time when styling the layout and colors of an app. I'm interested in learning how to automate my workflow more; Sass (precompiled CSS) has made me into a believer.<span class="d-block">No matter what the focus of the work, I'm happiest in front of a keyboard.</span></p>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>At <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/student-handbook/">Epicodus</a> we learned to prototype, to design, and then to build business web applications. They employ an unusual teaching model where students work on progressively tougher material in pairs, with help on demand from floating instructors. This was really fun, and a big change from previous attempts when I'd give up learning foundational programming concepts like functions and iteration because I was working by myself and couldn't wrap my head around them. At Epicodus, the active dialog with another learner made a huge difference for me. I've realized that I like using technology when it influences and affects other people, and also that I can learn it much more easily when working with others.</p>
          <p>For a few years in the military I worked to maintain and sometimes deploy data and voice networks and I even had some experience with legacy stuff that was highly classified. After a childhood spent messing around with Windows, this work seemed like a natural enough next step and I loved the variety of technologies I was trained to operate and troubleshoot.</p>
          <p>I left to finish my bachelor's degree using the GIBill. I built simple websites for friends and dabbled in affiliate marketing and AdWords. Exploring majors lead me to Psychology. Then I began a master's in archives and records management, in order to work in the cloud storage industry. I reluctantly realized that a better way to pursue this interest would be to finally learn how to write code professionally.</p>
